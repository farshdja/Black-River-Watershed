# Black-River-Watershed
This repository includes Python and MATLAB scripts developed for a study assessing flood hydrology in the Black River Watershed. MATLAB was utilized for statistical analysis and HBV hydrological modeling, while Python was employed for machine learning and hybrid modeling using Random Forest and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs).

The file "Final Dataset.xlsx" contains both the input data required for the models and analyses as well as the study outputs. Ensure this file is placed in the directory of each model for the codes to execute properly. For further inquiries, please email farshad.jahangiri@sharif.edu.
