# Black-River-Watershed
This repository includes Python and MATLAB scripts developed for a study assessing flood hydrology in the Black River Watershed. MATLAB was utilized for statistical analysis and HBV hydrological modeling, while Python was employed for machine learning and hybrid modeling using Random Forest and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs).
